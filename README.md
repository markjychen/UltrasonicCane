Serial Connection Development Branch

# Goal of Serial Branch
* Create a Serial connection so Ultrasonic Cane can be tested
* Currently only need to have PIC send data over; may need a way to communicate eventually if buttons don't work
* Will need to have own electronic circuit for serial communication; currently goal is to implement it over RS232-USB

# Current Status:
* Implemented Lab A.4 Code for RS232 Communication
